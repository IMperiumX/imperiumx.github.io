- ## Things to look out for during interviews
	- Clarify if there are duplicate values in the array. Would the presence of duplicate values affect the answer? Does it make the question simpler or harder?
	- When using an index to iterate through array elements, be careful not to go out of bounds.
	- Be mindful about slicing or concatenating arrays in your code. Typically, slicing and concatenating arrays would take O(n) time. Use start and end indices to demarcate a subarray/range where possible.
- ## Corner cases
	- Empty sequence
	- Sequence with 1 or 2 elements
	- Sequence with repeated elements cloze emphasizes both the repetition and order of elements in the sequence
	- Duplicated values in the sequence cloze highlights the presence of duplicate values without giving as much importance to the order of elements.
